Welcome to my Java Projects!

The Coding Competition Base template is a code structure for a better and faster competition experience.\
I have created the template in order to use it as a template for my team.

The OOP Practice files are from CSC1302 lab. It helped me to grasp the concept of OOP firmly.

The Google competition problem is from Google's tech event. Many problems could be solved without coding, but this one in particular would be impossible to do it without a computer's assistance.\
It returns an integer (count) value after searching through integers which have digits that are sorted in an ascending order (parameter 1~1000).\
For example, 12, 123, 257, 689 would be counted.
